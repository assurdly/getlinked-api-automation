While he has relevant experience, it is less than two years, which is on the lower end of the experience spectrum for this role. There is no mention of experience with Ruby, which is also listed as a desired skill. The applicant may need to improve his proficiency in these areas to fully meet the job requirements. Additionally, while his experience is relevant, it is primarily focused on backend development, which may limit his exposure to other aspects of software engineering.","cv_and_resume_id":null,"cover_letter_id":null,"expected_salary":null,"is_talent":true,"unique_id":"2eeef54f-677c-4cbe-96f8-daba8a3e58a51738660262","job_stage":"Culture fit","trail":[{"event":"progression","moved_by":"Ayobami Alaran","timestamp":"2025-02-12T15:43:48.053075+00:00","stage_name":"Culture fit","applicant_name":"Chukwuka Ibejih"},{"event":"email","status":"Success","recipient":"danielibejih@gmail.com","timestamp":"2025-02-12T15:43:48.291757+00:00"}],"status":null,"offer_status":null,"cv_image_urls":[],"cv_analysis_completed":false,"is_existing_in_cv_parser_tbl":true,"is_seen":false,"is_viewed":false,"is_assessed":false,"preferred_locations":[],"from_bulk_cv":false,"created_at":"2025-01-24T10:15:28.210758+01:00","extracted_info":[],"screening_status":"pending","rejection_type":null,"rejection_date":null,"retry_count":0,"updated_at":"2025-02-12T16:43:48.291877+01:00","user":{"id":"8c08b611-1433-4240-9b92-13ffbb264f11","last_login":"2024-12-02T12:48:46.690769+01:00","is_superuser":false,"created_at":"2024-11-13T11:47:50.593797+01:00","updated_at":"2024-12-02T12:48:46.691002+01:00","first_name":"Chukwuka","middle_name":null,"last_name":"Ibejih","email":"danielibejih@gmail.com","email_verified":true,"password":"pbkdf2_sha256$870000$NspnXxHtYFoPNb8qSSGZgl$E6EzF/qDCWfO/94kMxaLYnY1Wiz163A9U7Ydo5gZLa8=","phone_number":"+2349037741809","phone_verified":false,"address":null,"gender":"M","user_type":"TALENT","date_of_birth":null,"is_active":true,"is_staff":false,"referral_code":null,"has_updated_password":false,"groups":[],"user_permissions":[]},"job":{"id":141,"unique_id":"d9f212a1-209b-4e4e-8b5c-cb0658240db7","job_title":"Software Engineer","description":"We are seeking a talented Software Engineer to join our Technology and Information Technology (IT) team.
